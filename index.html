          <p style="max-width: 500px;">11th & Pine is a documentary theater project exploring how the community remembers the organized protests on Capitol Hill during the summer of 2020. We are interested in capturing the local histories of the CHOP from those who lived, worked, and protested on Capitol Hill at the time. Through oral history interviews, we seek to uncover how community members remember, understand, and continue to be impacted by the events of that summer. In partnership with Sound Theater Company, the collected interviews will be transformed into a live theater work where the community’s stories are brought to life on stage. Weaving together personal testimonies with theater, we will tell the story of the organized protests from the perspectives of those who bore witness to its unfolding. This project gets to the heart of the uniquely localized circumstances that gave birth to a movement.</p>

                      <p>Stories have the power to move us, open our hearts and minds, and connect us to worlds and people beyond ourselves. She carries this belief into her oral history practice where she interviews people from all walks of life about the issues that matter to them. As a playwright, she adapts oral histories for the stage, reflecting communities to themselves. Her documentary plays have been staged at The Soraya (Los Angeles), New College of Florida (Sarasota), the Hammer Theatre (San José), the Marsh (San Francisco), Links Hall (Chicago), and the Chicago Cultural Center. When she's not writing creatively, Nikki writes academically about the ethics and politics of doing community-engaged performance work. She has been published in; Theatre Journal, Text and Performance Quarterly, Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, and the Western Journal of Communication. She has given talks and led workshops on storytelling at Stanford University, Columbia University, UNC-Chapel Hill, and other academic institutions across the country. Her recent work; <a href="https://www.themothersplay.com/" target="blank">The (M)others</a>, was produced with funding from The Andrew W Mellon Foundation, The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and The Whitman Institute.</p>

                      <p>I became interested in the CHOP for all that it represented and what it hoped to accomplish. Perhaps what I sought is to fill the gap of missing the Lebanese revolution in October 2019 where people also occupied the streets and created temporary free zones against the corrupted regime that never misses the opportunity to practice racism, nepotism, and confessionalism while transforming the city into clusters where injustice and inequality proliferate. I wanted to speak to that!!!</p>

                  <p>Daisy Harrison Schreiber is an actor, writer, oldest sister, and rising junior at the University of Washington. She is currently majoring in Drama and English, and thinks of the School of Drama as her college home. Daisy believes that denying people access to representative stories is an act of violence and that good art is anything that helps us feel less alone. She is deeply interested in the intersection of storytelling and truth, specifically how honesty can be consciously used to create impactful and valuable narratives. Performance Ethnography strikes her as a beautiful way to explore this very kind of work!

                <p>Sam is a communication student and a performer studying at the University of Washington. His passion is storytelling: the ways that the stories we tell ourselves and others, be they fictional or factual, shape the way we see the world. The stories that came from Capitol Hill in June of 2020 were broadcast across the country and came to define the opinions many held towards Black Lives Matter Protesters. This research presents an opportunity to refocus discussion of the CHOP on those actually involved – to learn and tell the human stories of the protest and draw truth and meaning from the protest’s legacy.
